# BetaAlpha

Our Orbital Project is about creating an app that aims to fundamentally improve the userâ€™s bouldering ability by keeping track of the userâ€™s mistakes and help identify his/her weaknesses. 

## Description

Our application involves the user uploading a video of him/herself attempting the boulder problem and the application aims to help analyse the userâ€™s attempt at the problem. This will be based on breaking down the userâ€™s body positioning, centre of gravity as well as using vectors to model the usersâ€™ direction of movement on the wall. As it is also common practice for climbers who successfully completed the boulder problem to upload their video of successful attempts on social media, the user can therefore compare his/her attempt with other successful climbers similar to his/her physical proportions to learn about ways to improve and do better for the next attempt by simply running their videos through our appâ€™s built in analysis as well.

Furthermore, sending a problem does not fully indicate an improvement in the userâ€™s bouldering ability as boulder problems can be tweaked slightly which will demand a completely different beta to send the problem. Thus our app also aims to fundamentally improve the userâ€™s bouldering ability by keeping track of the userâ€™s mistakes and generating a training programme for the user. The user can then identify his weaknesses, be it pulling strength, finger strength, technique or flexibility.
